I received my B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Bilkent University in 2017, 2020, and 2023, respectively. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Bilkent University, working on the ERC project “TRANCIDS: Transmission over Channels with Insertions and Deletions.” My research interests include wireless communications, semantic communications, federated learning, and information theory and coding, particularly for transmission over channels with insertions and deletions.
